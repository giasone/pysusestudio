A SUSE Studio library for Python!

Features:
  Up-to-date with Suse Studio api.
  Actively under development.
  Supports all of the Suse Studio api endpoints.
  

Getting started:
  This is a Python library that works with the Suse Studio API. This libraries uses XML-RPC, thatâ€™s not necessarily good but I just thought it fit better in to Python since XML-RPC is part of the standard python library. The format that the API functions return is a nested dictionary, it might change later to something more palatable. Other features include a streamlined authentication process and an integrated upload method. Anyway, this whole library came to be because I am working on a Suse Studio client that I will be releasing shortly i think. Here is how it works:

username = 'myusername'
password = 'mypassword' 
    
# Instantiate with Basic (HTTP) Authentication
objSS = pySuseStudio(username, password)

# This returns the Account information
account = objSS.getAccount()
print account


Installing:  
  You may use easy_install to quickly get pysusestudio installed on your system:
      easy_install pysusestudio  (run as root)
  You may also clone/download the source code and then execute:
      python setup.py install (run as root)
  If you wish you may also bundle the pySuseStudio package with your application.

TODO:
  Python 3 support.
  Streaming API support.
  Cache system (memory, file, memcache client)
